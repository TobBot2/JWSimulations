                        I created this website as my junior workshop project for school, where students pick a topic they like and do a project on it. I enjoy coding and learning about science &ndash; especially physics. That is why I decided to create this website where I can create a collection of simulations on a website to share with the world.

                        The primary goal of this project is to help students around ninth grade visualize these topics in a highly interactive environment. The way I do this is by granting the user as much control over the simulation as possible. I have seen other simulations such as those at PHET simulations explain concepts well enough, but they usually only have presets that are far less interactive than I think is possible or necessary to be a useful tool. By not restricting the actions of students and allowing free experimentation, my simulations can be a better tool to use for students to fully grasp concepts.

                        This project was coded primarily in Javascript, supplemented with HTML5 and CSS for the user interface. If you would like to see the code, you can inspect the element on any given page or can head over to the <a href="https://github.com/TobBot2/JWSimulations">Github repository</a>.
