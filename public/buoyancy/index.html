                    Once the entire object is completely to the left of the right side of the water, it will interact with physics.

                    You can change the density of the object by clicking on an object to select it (it will be highlighted with red once selected), then changing the value of the slider.

                <p>
                    Buoyancy force is exerted by any fluid on any object within the fluid. It is defined as 
                    <var class="eq">F<sub>b</sub> = -pgV</var>
                    where <var>p</var> is the fluid’s density, <var>g</var> is the acceleration due to gravity, and <var>V</var> is the volume of the fluid that is displaced by the object. It is all multiplied by a negative because gravity is downward, whereas buoyancy is opposite that: upward.
                </p><p>
                    In the formula for buoyancy, there are no variables that correlate with the submerged object, so it would seem that all buoyancy forces are equal for all submerged objects. However the volume of an object that is submerged will change elements of the fluid itself - the volume displaced. This is one reason why different objects sink at different speeds. If it were the only reason, then a bowling ball would sink slower than a ping pong ball. This is because it only takes volume into account. Because a bowling ball is larger than a ping pong ball, it has a higher buoyancy force. The reason a bowling ball sinks faster (or sinks at all) is because of the other force: gravity. The force of gravity changes only when the mass of either object changes. Earth’s mass does not change, so it remains constant across all objects on it. Because the bowling ball is heavier than the ping pong ball, it has a larger gravitational force.
                </p><p>
                    When an object is submerged in water, for example, the object takes up space where the water used to be. That water that was there must go somewhere else, so it is displaced. The displaced water cannot leave its container because of the walls and floor, so it goes up. Once up, gravity pushes it down, but the object is in the way, so the water instead pushes up on the object to make room for it to go down.

                <p>
                    If you activate the 'Show Forces' toggle, you will notice in the simulation how the gravitational force (downwards in red) is only dependent on the density of the object. The buoyant force (updwards in blue) changes depending on how submerged it is in the water. The buoyant force does not increase once fully submerged. This is because buoyancy comes from pressure, which increases with depth. This would mean the buoyant force should increase as it gets deeper, but the pressure below and above increase at the same rate. The pressure might increase, but the buoyant force remains the same once fully submerged. Note that when the object stops moving, the gravitational and buoyant forces are equal.
